## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Flyway 11.x replaces Liquibase 5.0 (FSL license incompatible with open source constraint)
- [Roadmap]: ADMN-03 (Plaid config) grouped with Phase 7 (Plaid Integration), not Phase 8 (Administration)
- [Roadmap]: Categories split into own phase (Phase 4) before Transactions (Phase 5) -- envelopes and transactions both depend on categories
- [Revision]: Quality gates (INFR-04 to INFR-10) added to Phase 1 -- lint, format, static analysis, dead code, coverage thresholds, security scan, pre-commit hooks all enforced from day one

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 7 (Plaid): Needs research-phase -- Plaid EU/FR specific behaviors, institution availability for SG and Banque Populaire
- Envelope shared visibility: clarify whether User A and User B see same envelopes on shared account (decision needed before Phase 6)
